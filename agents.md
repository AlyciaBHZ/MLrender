# ML Concept Designer - Agent Prompt

Read this before making any change:

1. **No extra markdown files.** Update existing docs (project progress, resolved challenges log, open issues) instead of creating new ones unless the user explicitly requests it.
2. **Keep root clean.** Only `README.md`, `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`, and this file should live in the repo root; move or merge every other markdown note into `docs/` or the canonical files above.
3. **Setup & process notes live in `docs/`.** When documenting environment setup, workflows, or design specs, append to the appropriate file under `docs/` rather than scattering instructions elsewhere.
4. **Preserve chronology.** When adding status updates, group them by date inside `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` so the history stays chronological and easy to audit.
5. **Keep UTF-8 tidy.** Whenever you touch legacy files (e.g., `docs/APPEARANCE_LOG.md`, `docs/ML_Visual_Vocabulary_v1.md`, `docs/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, `docs/VISUAL_VOCABULARY_IMPLEMENTATION.md`, `docs/UIDESIGN_LOCK.md`), double-check encoding and clean mojibake instead of duplicating content.
6. **Self-audit.** After each session, confirm you did not introduce new standalone docs or regress the directory structure; fold any ad-hoc notes back into the canonical files immediately.
